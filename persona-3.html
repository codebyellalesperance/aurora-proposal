          <h4>The Reality</h4>
          <p>An elite performer running on broken infrastructure. Calendar reads: "Pool closed? alt??", "Media shoot (location missing)", "shoulder protocol new?? where??" HRV dropped from 78 to 62. Shoulder has "low-grade pain." Sleep still bad after Shanghai. The margins are razor-thin.</p>

          <blockquote>On the shoulder—we sourced two options in Dubai:<br>• Dr. Sanjay Sharma at Emirates Hospital — sports medicine, works with triathletes, can see you Wednesday 10am if you want imaging.<br>• DISC Sports & Spine — physio-first approach, focused on shoulder mechanics for swimmers. Can build a protocol, not just treat symptoms.<br><br>For Thursday's swim if the pool is closed: Hamdan Sports Complex has Olympic lanes open 6-8am. We confirmed availability.<br><br>Want us to book the specialist, the pool, or both?</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="rec-why">His shoulder is the thing that could end his career. We gave him two paths—diagnostic vs. treatment-focused—and solved the pool backup unprompted. That's the trust-building detail.</div>

We'd recommend leaving by 9:45.<br>• Your bag: What do you need on set?

Same meal, different cities. If you tell us what she likes, we'll set it up.<br><br>Or if you'd rather keep it simple, ignore this entirely.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="rec-why">We're not optimizing the call—we're creating a moment. "Same meal, different cities" is the kind of thoughtful gesture he doesn't have bandwidth to plan. It signals we understand what actually matters.</div>
